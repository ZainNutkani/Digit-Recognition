I developed a handwritten digit recognition system using Scikit-learn’s built-in digits dataset. The goal was to accurately classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) using a supervised machine learning approach.



Key Highlights:



→ Flattened each image into a 64-dimensional vector and standardized the features using StandardScaler to optimize model performance.



→ Trained a Logistic Regression classifier with multiclass support.



→ Achieved a test accuracy of around 96.67%, assessed performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.



→ Built an interactive GUI using Tkinter to allow users to draw digits on a canvas and receive real-time predictions from the trained Logistic Regression model.



This project serves as a foundational step toward more advanced image recognition tasks.
